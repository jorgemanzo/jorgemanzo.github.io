# Conversion Calculator (for now)

### What is this?
This is a calculator that just converts Decimal <=> Binary <=> Hexadecimal as well as nevative values.

### Why did you make this?
I made this because I took CS 271 (Assembly) at my school, and one of the things I struggled most with was 
converting Decimal <=> Binary <=> Hexadecimal (I know right?) So I figured it why not learn two things at once;
learn how to convert these bases better while also making mainly a JS app that I can use to convert numbers
faster later. Sounds good right? :D
